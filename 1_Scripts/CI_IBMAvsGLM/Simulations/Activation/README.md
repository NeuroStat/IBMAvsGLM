# Overview
* Simulations on an 8 by 8 grid of voxels: activation data + white noise + between-study variability.
* 29 subjects per study.
* vector of [5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50] studies per MA.
* 500 simulations (so far)
* Run on the HPC infrastructure

Analyzed using [?]() script.

# Between-study variability
The folder _BSVar_ contains an assessment of empirical between-study variability in the fMRI literature.

# True values_
The folder _TrueValues_3levels_ contains an investigation of the true effect size in the 3 level case of fMRI data.

# Variance at second level
The folder _Variance_2levels_ contains an investigation of the variance estimation using FSL at group level. Do we observe problems here before going to third level?
