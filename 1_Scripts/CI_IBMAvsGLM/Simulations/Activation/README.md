# Between-study variability
The folder _BSVar_ contains an assessment of empirical between-study variability in the fMRI literature.

# True values_
The folder _TrueValues_3levels_ contains an investigation of the true effect size in the 3 level case of fMRI data.

# Variance at second level
The folder _Variance_2levels_ contains an investigation of the variance estimation using FSL at group level. Do we observe problems here before going to third level?
